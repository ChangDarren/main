== Introduction

TopDeck is a desktop app for anyone who relies on flash cards to memorise things.

TopDeck helps you digitise your flash cards and keeps them organised.
You can easily review your cards and TopDeck will track your performance.
Improve your memory without the hassle of managing a physical pile of cards!

TopDeck has  a Command Line Interface (CLI), which means that users can
interact with the program easily by typing commands in. It also has a Graphical User Interface (GUI),
a visual display of the app, so that users can see the decks and cards stored.


If this sounds like the tool you have been looking for,
jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

To get started with TopDeck:

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `topdeck.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for TopDeck.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

Once you have set up TopDeck, you can try these commands:

* `add Capitals` : creates a new deck named "Capitals"
* `delete 3` : deletes the third deck in the list
* `exit` : exits the app

You may refer to <<commands>> for details of each command.

== User interface

TopDeck's interface is seperated into three different views.
By default, TopDeck starts in <<decksview,Decks View>>.

=== Decks View [[decksview]]

This view displays a list of the decks in your collection.


In decks view, you can:

- Create, edit, delete and find decks.
- Open a deck to view its contents. TopDeck will enter <<cardsview,cards view>>.

- Export or Import a deck.

=== Cards View [[cardsview]]

This view displays the cards in a particular deck. In cards view, you can:

- Create, edit and delete cards in the deck.
- View your performance for specific cards.

=== Study View [[studyview]]

In this view you can study a deck of cards.

- Test your knowledge of the cards in your chosen deck
- Rate the difficulty of the cards.

==== Deleting a card in the active deck: `delete`

**Auto-Complete**: Instead of typing the whole command,
TopDeck also provides an auto-complete feature for the `edit` command.
Users need only type `edit INDEX` and TopDeck will fill up the commandline
for the user to edit accordingly.

Below is a walk-through of the `edit` command:

Suppose the user adds a new card with a typo:

image::card_ug_diagrams/edit_card_1.png[width="800"]

The user can then retrieve the full detail of the card by simply typing `edit 2`

image::card_ug_diagrams/edit_card_2.png[width="800"]

After pressing enter, the following should appear:

image::card_ug_diagrams/edit_card_3.png[width="800"]

The user can then edit and correct the mistake made.

image::card_ug_diagrams/edit_card_4.png[width="800"]


==== Finding a card in the active deck by name: `find`

**Format**: `find KEYWORD [KEYWORD]...`

**Search for phrases**: TopDeck provides users the ability to search for
specific question by searching for a whole phrase instead of only individual words.
This is done by putting `"` around `KEYWORD`.

[CAUTION]
Phrases should have only alphanumeric characters and spaces.

**Outcome**: Lists all cards within the current deck containing `KEYWORD` in its text.

[NOTE]
`find` will only search for full-matching words. For e.g. `Animals` will not be found if
`animal` is used to search for it.

**Example**:

* `find animals`

Below is the result of executing this command:

image::card_ug_diagrams/find_card_2.png[width="800"]

* `find "What is the largest"`
