== Overview

This document serves to document my contributions to TopDeck, the project I worked on
as part of our introductory software engineering module in NUS.
TopDeck is a flash card application bulit on top of the code from
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[Addressbook Level 4].



One of the key features of our application is the simplicity that we would like
to provide out user in terms of the commands and this meant that we had to implement states for
different part of the application namely, a state for card management, decks management and
one for studying the cards. I was in charge of implementing this states and decided to implement it
using polymorphism.


== Summary of Contributions

This section summarises my key contributions to TopDeck:

* **Major Enhancement**: Designed the API for a stateful user interface.

 -

 - Justification:



**Enhancement added:** I modified the architecture of our software such that
stateful interface is supported. I added the state management features in the application so that the
same commands given by the user can be overloaded. For example, `add` can mean both
adding a deck or a card depending on which state the app is currently in.

Justification: A user should be able to execute simple commands easily instead of having
to give a context to the application.


**Code Contributed:** Please view our github page to see the code that I have contributed.

**Other contributions**:

* Project management:
 - I ensured that members were on track and not falling behind.

* Enhancements to existing features:
 - I added the autocomplete feature to reduce typing needed for the "Edit Card" command.

* Documentation:
 - I made our documentation look better.

* Community:
 - I reviewed pull requests and gave comments on how my peers can improve the readability of their code.
 - I contributed to discussions on how the UI should look like, and how lists should be stored internally.
 - I put up issues and enhancements to keep our team on track.
 - I gave our team a few tips on the git workflow.

* Tools:


== Contributions to User Guide

== Quick Start

To get started with TopDeck:

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `topdeck.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for TopDeck.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

Once you have set up TopDeck, you can try these commands:

* `add Capitals` : creates a new deck named "Capitals"
* `delete 3` : deletes the third deck in the list
* `exit` : exits the app

You may refer to <<commands>> for details of each command.

== User interface

TopDeck's interface is seperated into three different views.
By default, TopDeck starts in <<decksview,Decks View>>.

=== Decks View [[decksview]]

This view displays a list of the decks in your collection.
In decks view, you can:

- Create, edit and delete decks.
- Open a deck to view its contents. TopDeck will enter <<cardsview,cards view>>.
- Pick a deck to study. TopDeck will enter <<studyview,study view>>.

=== Cards View [[cardsview]]

This view displays the cards in a particular deck. In cards view, you can:

- Create, edit and delete cards in the deck.
- View your performance for specific cards.

=== Study View [[studyview]]

In this view you can study a deck of cards.

- Test your knowledge of the cards in your chosen deck
- Rate the difficulty of the cards.

== Commands [[commands]]

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
  Example: In `add DECK_NAME`, `DECK_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add Spanish`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
  Example: `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [t/TAG]` can be used as `q/China a/Beijing t/Asia` or as `q/China a/Beijing`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used any number of times including zero. +
  Example: `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Asia`, `t/trivia t/history` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
  Example: If the command specifies `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`, `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER` is also acceptable.

=== Stateful user interface
==== Introduction

TopDeck has a stateful user interface.
This means that the set of valid commands and their respective functionality
depend on the context of the application state.

For example, the command word `add` is "overloaded" with two capabilities:

1. In decks view, it adds a new deck: `add DECK_NAME`
2. In cards view, it adds a new card to a particular deck: `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`

It is the active state in TopDeck that resolves the actual command that is called.
Also, TopDeck does not request information from the user that is already implicit in the state
(e.g. the target deck in the second command).

The reasons for choosing to implement a stateful user interface are manifold.
Most importantly, it is necessary to support the implementation of study view which is stateful in nature.
A stateful user interface is also preferable to end users since it
requires less cognitive effort to operate by virtue of the fewer and shorter commands.

However, implementing state in full generality required nontrivial modifications to the AB4 architecture.
We will now describe how state is implemented in TopDeck.

==== Current implementation

States partition the functionalities that are exposed to users.
Hence, it is natural to consider distinct views in the user interface as separate states.
States in TopDeck correspond to the three possible views described in the user guide:
decks view, cards view and study view.

The following figure illustrates the transitions between these states.

"Cards view" --> [Close] "Decks view"
"Decks view" --> [Study] "Study view"
"Study view" -> [Finish study] "Decks view"
....
////

Each state implements a common interface `ViewState`
and holds transient data that is relevant only while the state is active.
For example, `CardsView` has a member `activeDeck` which holds a reference to the deck opened in decks view.
Commands in cards view such as `add` will then operate on this deck.

`ModelManager` owns the sole instance of `ViewState`.
Having only one instance of any state makes it trivial to enforce mutual exclusion.
The `Model` is also responsible for executing state transitions.
Each transition is exposed as a method in the `Model` API.
For example, `Model#changeDeck(Deck deck)` implements the transition from decks view to cards view.
As state entry is handled by the constructors of each state,
the implementation of a transition is as simple as constructing a new state object.

Technically, `Model#changeDeck(Deck deck)` can be called from any state, not just decks view.
This is a consequence of the design of `Model`.
The `Model` API is designed such that no state tracking is necessary.
All methods are expected to work regardless of the current state.
We assume that if a caller is capable of providing the required arguments to a method,
the method call is valid and expected.
This obviates the need for state-checking code in `ModelManager`.
