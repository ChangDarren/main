== About the project
My team and I were tasked to with morphing a basic commandline interface addressbook for our software
engineering project. We decided to morph the application into a Flashcard management application called TopDeck
TopDeck is a user-friendly tool that aims to help users better memorise any content that they desire. Users can use
it to learn a language, remember a math formula or simply recall an answer to a question.

The main functionality of the application include managing a list of decks, managing the cards within
each deck and having study sessions.

I was in-charge of the card's management feature within the application and these include creating,
reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) a card within a deck. The following sections illustrate these
enhancements as well as the relevant sections that I have included in the user and developer guides in relation
to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and
other helpful contributions to the team project.

Enhancement added: I added the ability for users to add, delete and edit cards.
Along with the usual CRUD operation, I also added a find feature.

* Justification: A user should be able to execute basic CRUD operations on a deck
of cards to customize the study session that the user will experience. A find feature will help
the user to locate the specific card especially when  they want to recall the question or
answer to the specific question.

* Highlights: The CRUD operation has to work with the existing commands and
data structure. This was challenging as the `Undo` and `Redo` methods in the
original application leverages of the immutability of the data structure. As such,
all commands have to implemented in a way that is immutable. Also, our application is
stateful as such, there is also a need to ensure both the state of the application and
the model is consistent with each other.

* Credits: The edit command has an auto-complete feature which was implemented
by my team mate  Wei Heng.

== Contributions to the User Guide
We had to update the original User Guide with new instructions for the different enhancements that we
have implemented. The following is an excerpt from **TopDeck User Guide**, showing the additions that I
have made for Card Management.

=== Cards View

These commands are only available in cards view.
In this section, the active deck is the deck used in the `open` command.

[NOTE]
The Footer Bar will continue to track the number of decks in the app.

==== Selecting a card in the active deck: `select`

**Format**: `select INDEX`

**Outcome**: Selects the card in the deck with index at `INDEX`

**Example**: `select 1`

==== Adding a card to the active deck: `add`

**Format**: `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [t/TAG]`

**Outcome**: Creates a new card with question and answers and
adds it to the current deck.

**Example**: `add q/Hello a/World t/TopDeckSample`

Below is an example of what the user should see upon the execution of the command:

Before:

image::card_ug_diagrams/add_card_1.png[width="800"]

After:

image::card_ug_diagrams/add_card_2.png[width="800"]

==== Deleting a card in the active deck: `delete`

**Format**: `delete INDEX`

**Outcome**: Deletes the card at `INDEX`

**Example**: `delete 2`

==== Editing a card in the active deck: `edit`

**Format**: `edit INDEX q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [t/TAG]`

**Outcome**: Edits the text of the card at `INDEX`.

**Example**: `edit 1 q/Edit Hello a/World t/Editted`

**Auto-Complete**: Instead of typing the whole command,
TopDeck also provides an auto-complete feature for the `edit` command.
Users need only type `edit INDEX` and TopDeck will fill up the commandline
for the user to edit accordingly.

Below is a walk-through of the `edit` command:

Suppose the user adds a new card with a typo:

image::card_ug_diagrams/edit_card_1.png[width="800"]

The user can then retrieve the full detail of the card by simply typing
`edit 2` and pressing enter. The following would appear

image::card_ug_diagrams/edit_card_2.png[width="800"]

The user can then edit and correct the mistake made.

image::card_ug_diagrams/edit_card_3.png[width="800"]

This would be the end result:

image::card_ug_diagrams/edit_card_4.png[width="800"]

==== Finding a card in the active deck by name: `find`

**Format**: `find KEYWORD [KEYWORD]...`

**Search for phrases**: TopDeck provides users the ability to search for
specific question by searching for a whole phrase instead of only individual words.
This is done by putting `"` around `KEYWORD`.

**Outcome**: Lists all cards within the current deck containing `KEYWORD` in its text.

[NOTE]
`find` will only search for full-matching words. For e.g. `Animals` will not be found if
`animal` is used to search for it.

[CAUTION]
The entire phrase inside `"` will be matched word for word. For example, `find "Is there a question"`
will show the question with the entire phrase `Is there a question` and the phrase
`Is there a question?` will not be matched due to the extra `?`

**Example**:

* `find Singapore`

Below is the result of executing this command:

image::card_ug_diagrams/find_card_1.png[width="800"]

* `find "When was Singapore founded?"`

Below is the result of executing this command:

image::card_ug_diagrams/find_card_2.png[width="800"]

==== Clearing all cards in the active deck: `clear`

**Format**: `clear`

**Outcome**: Clears all of the cards in the deck.

==== Listing all cards in the active deck: `list`

**Format**: `list`

**Outcome**: Displays a list of all cards in the deck.

==== Studying the active deck: `study`

**Format**: `study`

**Outcome**: Enters study view with the current deck.

==== Returning to decks view: `back`

**Format**: `back`

**Outcome**: Returns to decks view.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide
The following section shows my additions to the TopDeck Developer Guide for the Card Management features.

=== Card management
==== Data structure

A Card consists of a question, an answer, its difficulty and the respective tags associated with it.
Card's are deemed as equal if they have the same question to prevent the user from
creating same question twice or to have 2 different answer for the same question.
Cards are stored inside a `Deck` as a list of unique cards.
The Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operation of a card in a chosen `Deck` is thus a modification of
the chosen `Deck`.

In order to facilitate the CRUD operations, `CardsView` contains `activeDeck` which is a reference to the
current deck that we are modifying.

[NOTE]
Before any Card related operation can be executed, `ViewState` in ModelManager has to be of type `CardsView`.
For more information refer to the section on ViewState management.

==== Current implementation

Card management is currently facilitated by `Model` which implements the following operations:

* hasCard(Card card, Deck deck)
* addCard(Card card, Deck deck)
* removeCard(Card target, Deck deck)
* editCard(Card newCard, Deck deck)

The CRUD operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#addCard(Card card, Deck deck)`,
`Model#deleteCard(Card target, Deck deck)` and `Model#setCard(Card target, Card newCard, Deck deck)`.
For each operation, there are 2 objects that need to be updated namely, `VersionedTopDeck` and `CardsView`.

Each CRUD operation can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Find the chosen deck using `CardsView.activeDeck` and create a new deck from it.
2. Execute `VersionedTopDeck#addCard(Card newCard, Deck deck)` or
`VersionedTopDeck#removeCard(Card target, Deck deck)` or
`VersionedTopDeck#setCard(Card target, Card editedCard, Deck deck)` using `CardsView.activeDeck`.
3. Update the `CardsView` with the new editedDeck.
4. Update the UI to reflect the new CardsView.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add operation works and how it
interacts with Undo/Redo:

[NOTE]
All other CRUD operations works the same except for the model call. Instead of
`Model#addCard(Card card, Deck deck)`, `Model#deleteCard(Card target, Deck deck)` or
`Model#setCard(Card target, Card newCard, Deck deck)` is called instead.

Step 1. The user starts up the application and is in the `DecksView`. The user then
executes the `open 1` command to open the first deck(D1 in the figure). This should change the
`ViewState` in the `ModelManager` from `DeckView` to `CardsView` and causes
`CardsView.activeDeck` to point to the first deck as per figure 4.3.1. For more information, refer to
the Deck feature.

image::card_dg_fig/card_fig_1.png[width="800", caption="Figure 1"]

Step 2. The user executes `add q/question a/answer` to add the new card into the current deck.
The `add` command is parsed and calls `Model#addCard(Card card, Deck deck)`.
`VersionedTopDeck(Card newCard, Deck deck)` is then called. D3 which is a copy
of D1 is created and the new card is added to D3. `VersionedTopDeck` is then updated
as per figure 4.3.2 by calling `UniqueDeckList.setDeck(Deck target, Deck editedDeck)`.

image::card_dg_fig/card_fig_2.png[width="800", caption="Figure 2"]

Step 3. Next, the CardsView is updated creating a new `CardsView` that points to D3
as in figure 4.3.3

image::card_dg_fig/card_fig_3.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3"]

Step 4. Once that is done, the `ModelManager.filteredItems` list and the UI is being updated to
reflect the change.

Step 5. Now the user executes `undo`. This results in the CurrentStatePointer to point
to the previous TopDeck as per figure 4.3.4

image::card_dg_fig/card_fig_4.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4"]

Step 6. Using D3, the application will get D1 in TopDeck that is pointed to by CurrentStatePointer.
A new CardsView(CardsView3) is then created and points to D1 as per figure 4.3.5. The application
then updates `ModelManager.filteredItems` and the UI is being updated.

image::card_dg_fig/card_fig_5.png[width="800", caption="Figure 5"]

Step 7. Now, the user executes redo. This results in the the CurrentStatePointer to point
to the next TopDeck as per figure 4.3.6

image::card_dg_fig/card_fig_6.png[width="800", caption="Figure 6"]

Step 8. Using D1, the application will get D3 in TopDeck that is pointed to by CurrentStatePointer.
   A new CardsView(CardsView4) is then created and points to D3 as per figure 4.3.7. The application
   then updates `ModelManager.filteredItems` and the UI is being updated.

image::card_dg_fig/card_fig_7.png[width="800", caption="Figure 7"]

Step 9. Below is the final state of `ModelManager`:

image::card_dg_fig/card_fig_8.png[width="800", caption="Figure 8"]

Below is a sequence diagram to illustrate the sequence of activities upon calling
`Model#addCard(Card card, Deck deck)`:

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure of Cards
* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Have a list of cards within each deck
** Pros: Allows for decks features such as import and export. Also, any search operation is
done within the deck only.
** Cons: There is a need to implement an extra `Deck` data structure and makes
the model more complicated.

* **Alternative 2(current choice):** Have a global list of cards with tags.
** Pros: Updating of UI will be easier as there is one global list only.
** Cons: In order to study the cards, the application has to search through the
global list to find the cards with the tags that we want to study. Organisation of
cards will also be messy as the only form of organisation for cards is through tagging.

* **Reason for choice 1:** Choice one was chosen as it would allow the user an extra layer of
organisation(`Deck` and `Tag`) when managing cards.

===== Aspect: How CRUD operation should work
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Recreate the CardViews after each operation
** Pros: Leverages on the current implementation of `VersionTopDeck` making it easier to
implement.
** Cons: There is a memory and operation overhead as a new `CardsView` is constantly being
created. Also, there is a need to refresh the UI at every update as the UI needs to render
the new `CardsView`.

* **Alternative 2:** Alter the card list in `CardsView` and the model upon each operation
** Pros: Only has to update the active Deck in CardsView and the model
** Cons: As `CardsView.activeDeck` can only reference to one deck only, the current Undo/Redo feature
will have to be re-implemented to store the previous commands and the object changed.

* **Reason for choice 1:** Choice one was chosen in order to retain the Undo/Redo function and to
leverage on the original architecture instead of changing it.
