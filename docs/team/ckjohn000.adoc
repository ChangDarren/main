== Overview

This portfolio documents my contributions to the project I have undertaken in the course CS2103T -
Software Engineering. It aims to demonstrate the theoretical and practical knowledge I have gained in the
field of Software Engineering over the semester.

== Project

TopDeck is a general purpose flashcard application created to solve the inherent problems associated with physical
flashcards. It aims to facilitate quick and intuitive management of virtual flashcards as well as having a study mode
which allows for extra-efficient studying. It comprises three management systems - 1) Deck, 2) Card, 3) Study, each
of which plays an indispensable role in ensuring the application's success. They were meticulously designed to be
simplistic and intuitive to use.

== Summary of Contributions

This section acts as a summary of my contributions to TopDeck.

**Enhancement added:** I added the deck list to allow for the management of decks and also the ability to import
 and export decks.

* What it does: The deck list allows users to better navigate and manage decks. It allows users to add, edit and
 find decks with ease. The ability to import and export whole decks removes the resource-intensive way of having to
 manually create decks and cards.

* Justification: In order for a flash card application to work seamlessly, it needs the ability to manage and store
cards easily. This deck management system allows the user to store related cards into decks. Importing also allows
users to download and import pre-made decks for quick and easy use. Exporting allows for portability and also the
sharing of decks between different users.

== Contributions to User Guide

=== Deck View

In this view you can create, edit and find decks. This is the default view when TopDeck is first launched.

image::deck_ug_diagrams/deck.png[width="800"]

These are commands only available in deck view.

==== Creating a deck: `add`

**Format**: `add n/DECK_NAME`

**Outcome**: Creates a new deck called `DECK_NAME`.

**Example**: `add n/History`

Before:

==== Deleting a deck: `delete`

**Format**: `delete INDEX`

**Outcome**: Deletes the deck at `INDEX`.

**Example**: `delete 2`

[NOTE]
====
The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed deck list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3...
====

image::deck_ug_diagrams/study_deck.png[width="800"]

==== Import a deck: `import`

To import a deck from the `json` file at the specified FILEPATH. +
Format: `import FILEPATH`

****
* You must include the filename of the target file in `FILEPATH`.
* This operation is only available in Decks View.
* The default base directory is the directory that the TopDeck.jar file is in.
****

**Example**:
Say you want to import a deck called "Economics" and you have the Economics.json file in the
same folder as TopDeck.jar.

image::deck_ug_diagrams/import_deck_1.png[width="350"]

* Simply  enter `import Economics` and TopDeck will import the deck "Economics".

Before:

image::deck_ug_diagrams/import_deck_2.png[width="800"]

After:

image::deck_ug_diagrams/import_deck_3.png[width="800"]

==== Export a deck: `export`

To create a `json` file of the deck at INDEX. +
Format: `export INDEX`

****
* INDEX must be a positive integer from 1 onwards and is based on the currently displayed list.
* This operation is only available in Decks View.
* The json file will be created in the same directory as the TopDeck.jar file.
****

Example:

* 1. First, display all the decks in TopDeck using `list`. +

image::deck_ug_diagrams/list_deck_2.png[width="800"]

* 2. Say you want to export "History" (the 3rd deck), simply enter the command: `export 3`. You should see the
following message:

image::deck_ug_diagrams/export_deck_1.png[width="800"]

"Economics.json" will be created in the same directory as the TopDeck.jar file. +

=== Deck operations

==== Current implementation

Deck operations are supported in TopDeck class: A Deck consists of a list of `cards`. Decks are deemed as equal if they
have the same name. This is to prevent users from creating 2 or more decks with the same name.

Within the Model, `Deck` is encapsulated by the following data structure:

* `Model`
* `VersionedTopDeck`
* `TopDeck`
* `UniqueDeckList`
* `Deck`

The Create, Read, Update and Delete(CRUD) operation will trickle down the encapsulations
and be executed in `UniqueDeckList`.

==== Current implementation

Deck Management is facilitated by `Deck` which implements the following operations:

* add(Deck deck)
* edit(Deck target, Deck editedDeck)
* delete(Deck deck)
* find(Name name)

The CRUD operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#addDeck(Deck deck)` and
`Model#deleteDeck(Deck toDelete)`. For each deck operation,
there are 2 main updates that need to be done. The first update will be on the model
and the second will be on the `ViewState`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addDeck(Deck) mechanism behaves at each step:

image::addDeckSequence.png[width="800"]

1. The user starts up the application and is in the `DecksView`. The user then
executes the `add` command `add n/NAME` to create a new deck. The `add` command
is parsed and calls `Model#addDeck(Deck deck)`.

2. `Model#addDeck(Deck deck)` first checks if the current state is a
DecksView. Following, it will create a new deck to be added into `VersionedTopDeck.addDeck(Deck deck).

3. Once that is done, the filteredItems list is being updated to reflect the change.

4. To continue to add `cards`, the user will then execute the command `select INDEX`. For example, user
executes the `select 1` command to select the first deck. This should change the `ViewState` in the
`ModelManager` from `DeckView` to `CardView`. For more information on `cards`, refer to cards's feature.

==== Design considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Implement the logic of deck operations in TopDeck class.

** Pros: Easy to implement and debug as all logic related with executing commands are implemented in TopDeck.
** Cons: Card class is not informed, or notified when its UniqueDeckList is modified. This might result in unexpected
behaviors if a deck command is executed and the person in charge of Card class assumes that the UniqueDeckList is
unmodified.

* *Alternative 2:* Implement the logic of card-level operations in Deck class.

** Pros: The responsibility of each class is clear, only a Deck can modify its list of cards.
** Cons: The logic for executing deck-level and card-level commands are implemented at different places.
We must ensure that the implementation of each command is correct.

* *Why Alternative 1:* Without changing the current Undo/Redo feature makes it difficult to implement as we have
decided to go with a stateful implementation. However being stateful allows for more features like our study mode in
the future.
