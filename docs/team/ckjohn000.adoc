== Overview

This portfolio documents my contributions to the project I have undertaken in the course CS2103T -
Software Engineering. It aims to demonstrate the theoretical and practical knowledge I have gained in the
field of Software Engineering over the semester.

== Project

TopDeck is a general purpose flashcard application created to solve the inherent problems associated with physical
flashcards. It aims to facilitate quick and intuitive management of virtual flashcards as well as having a study mode
which allows for extra-efficient studying.

== Summary of Contributions

This section acts as a summary of my contributions to TopDeck.

**Enhancement added:** I added the deck list to allow for the management of decks.

* What it does: The decklist allows users to better navigate and manage decks. It allows users to add, edit and
find decks with ease.

* Justification: In order for a flash card application to work seamlessly, it needs the ability to manage and store
cards easily. This deck management system allows the user to store related cards into decks.

**Other contributions**:

* Project management:
 - Ensured loose coupling between deck and card management.
 - Ensured Storage component of TopDeck preserved functionality throughout.

* Enhancements to existing features:
 - Added the ability to store a list of cards instead of just one card.
 - Wrote additional tests for existing features.

* Documentation:
 - Did changes to the user and developer guide to improve reader-friendliness of existing content.

* Community:
 - I reviewed pull requests for decks and cards.


== Contributions to User Guide

=== Deck View

In this view you can create, edit and find decks. This is the default view when TopDeck is first launched.

image::deck_ug_diagrams/deck.png[width="800"]

These are commands only available in deck view.

==== Creating a deck: `add`

**Format**: `add DECK_NAME`

**Outcome**: Creates a new deck called `DECK_NAME`.

**Example**: `add n/History`

Before:

==== Deleting a deck: `delete`

**Format**: `delete INDEX`

**Outcome**: Deletes the deck at `INDEX`.

**Example**: `delete 2`

[NOTE]
====
The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed deck list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3...
====

==== Editing the name of a deck: `edit`

**Format**: `edit INDEX NEW_DECK_NAME`

**Outcome**: Changes the name of the deck at `INDEX` to `NEW_DECK_NAME`.

**Example**: `edit 2 Addition`

Before:

image::deck_ug_diagrams/edit_deck_1.png[width="800"]

After:

image::deck_ug_diagrams/edit_deck_2.png[width="800"]

==== Finding a deck by name: `find`

**Format**: `find KEYWORD`

**Outcome**: Lists all decks containing `KEYWORD` in its name.

**Example**: `find sci`

Before:

image::deck_ug_diagrams/find_deck_1.png[width="800"]

After:

image::deck_ug_diagrams/find_deck_2.png[width="800"]

==== Listing all decks: `list`

**Format**: `list`

**Outcome**: Displays a list of all decks.

image::deck_ug_diagrams/list_deck_1.png[width="800"]

image::deck_ug_diagrams/list_deck_2.png[width="800"]


==== Navigating into a deck: `open`

**Format**: `open INDEX`

**Outcome**: Opens the deck at `INDEX`

**Example**: `open 1`

image::deck_ug_diagrams/open_deck.png[width="800"]

==== Studying a deck: `study`

**Format**: `study INDEX`

**Outcome**: Enters study view with the deck at `INDEX`.

**Example**: `study 1`

image::deck_ug_diagrams/study_deck.png[width="800"]

==== Import a deck: `import`

To import a deck from the `json` file at the specified FILEPATH. +
Format: `import FILEPATH`

****
* You must include the filename of the target file in `FILEPATH`.
* This operation is only available in Decks View.
* The default base directory is the directory that the TopDeck.jar file is in.
****

**Example**:
Say you want to import a deck called "Economics" and you have the Economics.json file in the
same folder as TopDeck.jar.

image::deck_ug_diagrams/import_deck_1.png[width="350"]

* Simply  enter `import Economics` and TopDeck will import the deck "Economics".

Before:

image::deck_ug_diagrams/import_deck_2.png[width="800"]

After:

image::deck_ug_diagrams/import_deck_3.png[width="800"]

==== Export a deck: `export`

To create a `json` file of the deck at INDEX. +
Format: `export INDEX`

****
* INDEX must be a positive integer from 1 onwards and is based on the currently displayed list.
* This operation is only available in Decks View.
* The json file will be created in the same directory as the TopDeck.jar file.
****

Example:

* 1. First, display all the decks in TopDeck using `list`. +

image::deck_ug_diagrams/list_deck_2.png[width="800"]

* 2. Say you want to export "History" (the 3rd deck), simply enter the command: `export 3`. You should see the
following message:

image::deck_ug_diagrams/export_deck_1.png[width="800"]

"Economics.json" will be created in the same directory as the TopDeck.jar file. +

=== Deck operations

==== Current implementation

Deck operations are supported in TopDeck class: A Deck consists of a list of `cards`. Decks are deemed as equal if they
have the same name. This is to prevent users from creating 2 or more decks with the same name.

Within the Model, `Deck` is encapsulated by the following data structure:

* `Model`
* `VersionedTopDeck`
* `TopDeck`
* `UniqueDeckList`
* `Deck`

The Create, Read, Update and Delete(CRUD) operation will trickle down the encapsulations
and be executed in `UniqueDeckList`.

==== Current implementation

Deck Management is facilitated by `Deck` which implements the following operations:

* add(Deck deck)
* edit(Deck target, Deck editedDeck)
* delete(Deck deck)
* find(Name name)

The CRUD operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#addDeck(Deck deck)` and
`Model#deleteDeck(Deck toDelete)`. For each deck operation,
there are 2 main updates that need to be done. The first update will be on the model
and the second will be on the `ViewState`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addDeck(Deck) mechanism behaves at each step:

image::addDeckSequence.png[width="800"]

1. The user starts up the application and is in the `DecksView`. The user then
executes the `add` command `add n/NAME` to create a new deck. The `add` command
is parsed and calls `Model#addDeck(Deck deck)`.

2. `Model#addDeck(Deck deck)` first checks if the current state is a
DecksView. Following, it will create a new deck to be added into `VersionedTopDeck.addDeck(Deck deck).

3. Once that is done, the filteredItems list is being updated to reflect the change.

4. To continue to add `cards`, the user will then execute the command `select INDEX`. For example, user
executes the `select 1` command to select the first deck. This should change the `ViewState` in the
`ModelManager` from `DeckView` to `CardView`. For more information on `cards`, refer to cards's feature.

==== Design considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Implement the logic of deck operations in TopDeck class.

** Pros: Easy to implement and debug as all logic related with executing commands are implemented in TopDeck.
** Cons: Card class is not informed, or notified when its UniqueDeckList is modified. This might result in unexpected
behaviors if a deck command is executed and the person in charge of Card class assumes that the UniqueDeckList is
unmodified.

* *Alternative 2:* Implement the logic of card-level operations in Deck class.

** Pros: The responsibility of each class is clear, only a Deck can modify its list of cards.
** Cons: The logic for executing deck-level and card-level commands are implemented at different places.
We must ensure that the implementation of each command is correct.

* *Why Alternative 1:* Without changing the current Undo/Redo feature makes it difficult to implement as we have
decided to go with a stateful implementation. However being stateful allows for more features like our study mode in
the future.
