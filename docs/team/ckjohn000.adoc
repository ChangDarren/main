This portfolio aims to provide a summary of my contribution towards the project I have undertaken in the
course CS2103T - Software Engineering.

== Overview

TopDeck is a desktop app for anyone who relies on flash cards to memorise things.
It comprises three different view states - 1)Deck, 2)Card, 3)Study, each of which plays
a role to help you digitise your flash cards and keeps them organised.
You can easily review your cards and TopDeck will track your performance.

Improve your memory without the hassle of managing a physical pile of cards!

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to manage decks*
** What it does: allows the user manage decks in *deck view*.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it can be hard to manage multiple cards.
 To have a list of decks, each deck containing similar cards allows for better management.

** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_
